The input data is a meeting transcript, which may contain several presentations provided 
by different individuals. For this meeting, we need to extract the following general fields:  
- Participants: A list of the names of the meeting participants.  
- Goal: The goals of the meeting based on the transcript.  
- ActionItems: A list of identified action items. Action item is a specific task or activity assigned to a person.
- Decisions: A list of decisions made during the meeting.  

For each identified presentation, please capture the following information:  
- Time: The start and end times of the presentation or discussion.  
- Item: The main discussion topic or point.  
- Presenter: The name of the presenter (if identified).  
- Notes: A brief summary of the key points discussed during the presentation.  

If a field is not available, skip it in the JSON structure.  
Use the audio segments to populate the DiscussionTopics.  

The final JSON structure should be as follows:

{
  "Participants": ["Participant 1", "Participant 2", "..."],
  "Goals": ["Goal1 of the meeting", "Goal2 of the meeting", "..."],
  "DiscussionTopics": [
    {
      "Time": "start_time - end_time",
      "Item": "Main Discussion Topic",
      "Presenter": "Name of Presenter (if available)",
      "Notes": "Key points discussed"
    }
    // Additional presentations
  ],
  "ActionItems": ["Action item1", "Action item2", "..."],
  "Decisions": ["Meeting decision1", "Meeting decision2", "..."]
}

The resulting JSON should be extractable with this regular expression:  
`r'```json\s*(\{.*\})\s*```'`
